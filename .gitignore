# --- Log files ---
# Ignore all content within the logs directory, except for .gitkeep
logs/*
!logs/.gitkeep

# --- Model files ---
# Ignore all content within the models directory, except for .gitkeep
# This prevents committing large model files downloaded by Hugging Face.
models/*
!models/.gitkeep
# If models are in subdirectories like models/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-SOLAR-10.7B/
# then models/** might be more appropriate, still with !models/.gitkeep.
# For simplicity, models/* covers direct children. If deep nesting of empty dirs
# that need tracking is a concern, then a more specific approach might be needed,
# but usually .gitkeep in the root of `models` is sufficient.

# Ignore virtual environment directories. Common names include venv, .venv, vllm_env.
*venv/
vllm_env/
.venv/

# --- Configuration Files ---
# Ignore the actual configuration file containing sensitive tokens.
